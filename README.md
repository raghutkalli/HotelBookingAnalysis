# HotelBookingAnalysis
The Hotel Booking Analysis Project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive insights from a dataset related to hotel bookings. EDA involves examining and visualizing data patterns to uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies. This project aims to enhance decision-making processes within the hotel industry by identifying factors influencing booking patterns, such as peak booking periods, preferred room types, and customer demographics. Through comprehensive data exploration, the project seeks to provide valuable information for optimizing hotel operations and improving customer satisfaction.
